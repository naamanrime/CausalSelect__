\title{
Outcome-Adaptive Lasso (OAL) for High-Dimensional Causal Inference
}
\description{
Estimates the average treatment effect (ATE) using the Outcome-Adaptive Lasso (OAL)method, which performs variable selection by weighting the penalty based on the importance of covariates in the outcome model.
}
\usage{
OAL(X,A,Y)
}
\arguments{
  \item{X}{A numeric matrix or data frame of covariates with \eqn{n} rows (observations) and \eqn{p} columns (variables).}
  \item{A}{A binary treatment vector of length \eqn{n}.}
  \item{Y}{A numeric outcome vector of length \eqn{n}.}
}
\details{
This function :
\itemize{
  \item fits a linear model for the outcome to compute adaptive weights
  \item applies an adaptive lasso penalty to estimate the propensity score model
  \item computes inverse probability of treatment weights (IPTW) and ATE estimates across a grid of penalty values (\eqn{\lambda})
  \item selects the optimal \eqn{\lambda} by minimizing the weighted absolute mean difference (wAMD) across covariates
}
}
\value{
A numeric vector containing:
  \item{OAL}{Estimated average treatment effect (ATE) for the optimal lambda.}
  \item{mOAL}{A binary vector indicating selected variables (1 if selected, 0 otherwise).}
